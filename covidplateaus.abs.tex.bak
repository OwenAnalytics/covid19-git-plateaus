The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 200,000 reported deaths
globally of which more than 50,000 deaths have been reported
in the United States alone. Public health interventions
have had significant impacts in reducing transmission and in
avereting even more deaths. Nonetheless, in many jurisidictions
(both at national and local levels) the decline of cases and fatalities
after apparent epidemic `peaks' has not been rapid.  Instead, the asymmetric
decline in cases appears, in some cases, to be consistent
with plateau- or shoulder-like phenomena.  
Here we propose a model of fatality-driven
awareness in which individual protective measures increase
as death rates exceed critical awareness levels. 
As a result, we find that epidemic dynamics
can be characterized by long, dangerous plateaus, shoulders,
and lag-driven oscillations after exponential rises
in cases at the outset of disease dynamics. We also show that
long-term awarness can avoid peak resurgence and accelerate
epidemic decline.  We suggest that the generic nature of such plateaus should
be considered in developing public health interventions that impose
external limits to interactions with
intrinsic, responses of individuals to awareness of the
severity of the near- and long-term epidemic.
