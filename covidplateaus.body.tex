\section{Introduction}
The spread of COVID-19 has elevated the importance of epidemiological
models as a means to forecast both near- and long-term spread. 
In the United States, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)
model has emerged as a key influencer of state- and national-level
policy \citep{covid2020forecasting}.  
The IHME model includes a detailed characterization
of the variation in
hospital bed capacity, ICU beds, and ventilators between and within
states. Predicting the projected strains on underlying
health resources is critical to supporting planning efforts.
However such projections require
an epidemic `forecast'.  The IHME's epidemic forecast
differs from conventional
epidemic models in a significant way -- IHME assumes
that the cumulative deaths in the COVID-19 epidemic 
follow a symmetric, Gaussian-like trajectory. 
For example, the 
IHME model predicts that if the peak is 2 weeks away then in 4 weeks
cases will return to the level of the present, and continue
to diminish rapidly.  But, epidemics need not have one symmetric peak -- 
the archaic Farr's Law of Epidemics notwithstanding
(see~\citep{bregman1990farr} for a cautionary tale of using
Farr's law as applied to the HIV epidemic).

Conventional epidemic
models of COVID-19 represent populations in terms of their `status' vis
a vis the infectious agent, i.e., susceptible, exposed, infectious,
hospitalized, and recovered~\citep{ferguson2020report,kucharski2020early,kissler_medrxiv2020,park_medrxiv2020,kraemer_2020sci,li_science2020,wu_2020natmed}.
New transmission can lead to an exponential increases in cases 
when the basic reproduction number ${\cal{R}}_0>1$ (the
basic reproduction number denotes the average number of new
infections caused by a single, typical individual in an otherwise
susceptible population \citep{anderson1991infectious}).  Subsequent
spread, if left unchecked, would yield a single peak -- in theory. That 
peak corresponds to when `herd immunity' is reached, such
that the effective reproduction number, $\Reff=1$.
The effective reproduction number denotes the number of new
infectious cases caused by a single infectious individual
in a population with pre-existing circulation.
But, even when herd immunity is reached, there will still be new cases 
which then diminish over time, until the epidemic concludes.  
A single-peak paradigm is
only robust insofar as the disease has spread
sufficiently in a population to reach and exceed `herd immunity'.
The converse
is also true in the case of COVID-19 -- as long as 
a population remains predominantly immunologically
naive, then the risk of further infection has not passed. 

The Imperial College of London (ICL) model~\citep{ferguson2020report} is
one of the most influential of 
epidemiogical models shaping public health responses to COVID-19. The ICL model is an
example of a `conventional' epidemic model
that shows the benefits of  early intervention steps in reducing
transmission and preserving health system resources vs.~a `herd immunity' strategy.  
The ICL model assumes that
transmission is reduced because of externalities, like lockdowns,
school closings, and so on.  
As a result, the ICL model suggests that lifting of large-scale
public health interventions could be followed by a second wave of cases.
Yet, for a disease
that is already the documented cause of more than 70,000 deaths
in the United States alone, we posit that individuals
are likely to continue to modify
their behavior even after lockdowns are lifted.  
Indeed, the peak death rates in the United States and globally
are not as high as potential maximums in the event that
COVID-19 had spread unhindered in the population~\citep{ferguson2020report}. 
Moreover, rather than a peak and decline, there is evidence at both national
and within-US state scales of plateaus and shoulder like
behavior for daily fatality rates (Figure~\ref{fig.plateaus_cases}).   

In this manuscript we use a nonlinear model of epidemiological dynamics to
ask the question: what is the anticipated
shape of an epidemic if individuals modify their behavior in direct
response to the impact of a disease at the population level? In doing so,
we build upon earlier work on awareness based models (e.g.~\citep{funk2009spread,funk2010modelling,eksin2017disease, eksin2019systematic}) with an
initial assumption: individuals reduce interactions when 
death rates are high and increase interactions when death rates are low.  
As we show, short-term awareness can lead to dramatic reductions
in death rates compared to models without accounting for behavior,
leading to plateaus, shoulders,
and lag-driven oscillations in death rates. We also show that dynamics
can be driven from persistent dynamics to elimination when
awareness shifts from short- to long-term.


\section{Results and Discussion}
\subsection{SEIR Model with Short-Term Awareness of Risk}
Consider an SEIR like model
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{S} &=& -\frac{\beta SI}{\left[1+\left(\delta/\delta_c\right)^{k}\right]}\\
\dot{E} &=& \frac{\beta SI}{\left[1+\left(\delta/\delta_c\right)^{k}\right]}-\mu E\\
\dot{I} &=& \mu E-\gamma I \\
\dot{R} &=& (1-f_D)\gamma I\\
\dot{D} &=& f_D\gamma I
\end{eqnarray}
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\dot{S} &=& -\beta SI a(\vec{x}) \\
%\dot{E} &=& \beta SI} a(\vec{x})}-\mu E\\
%\dot{I} &=& \mu E-\gamma I \\
%\dot{R} &=& (1-f_D)\gamma I
%\dot{D} &=& f_D)\gamma I
%\end{eqnarray}
%where $a(\vec{x})$ denotes awareness-based distancing given the
%epidemiological phase space
where $S$, $E$, $I$, $R$, and $D$ denote the proportions of
susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered, and deaths, respectively,
given transmission rate $\beta$ /day, transition
to infectious rate $\mu$ /day, recovery rate $\gamma$ /day,
where $f_D$ is the infection fatality probability.
The awareness-based distancing is controlled by 
the death rate $\delta\equiv \dot{D}$,
the half-saturation constant ($\delta_c>0$), and
the sharpness of change in the force of infection ($k\geq 1$)
(see Figure~\ref{fig.schematic} for a schematic).
Since $\delta$ is proportional to $I$, this model is closely related to a recently proposed awareness-based distancing model~\citep{eksin2019systematic}
and to an independently derived feedback SIR model~\citep{franco2020feedback}.
Note that the present
model converges to the conventional SEIR model as $\delta_c\rightarrow \infty$.

Unmitigated epidemics arising in SEIR models have a single case peak, corresponding 
to the point where $\gamma I = \beta S I $ such that 
the population obtains herd immunity when only a proportion
$S=1/{\cal{R}}_0$ have yet to be infected.
However, when individuals decrease transmission in relationship
to awareness of the population impacts of the disease, $\delta(t)$,
then the system can `peak' when levels of infected cases are
far from herd immunity, specifically when
\begin{equation}
\gamma I = \frac{\beta SI}{\left[1+\left(\delta/\delta_c\right)^{k}\right]}.
\end{equation}
When $\delta_c$ is small compared to the per-capita death rate of infectious individuals $(\gamma f_D)$ we anticipate that individual behavior will respond quickly to the disease outbreak.
Hence, we hypothesize that the
emergence of an
awareness-based peak can occur early, i.e., $S(t)\approx 1$, consistent
with a quasi-stationary equilibrium when the death rate is
\begin{equation}
\delta^{(q)} \approx \delta_c\left({\cal{R}}_0-1\right)^{1/k}
\end{equation}
and the infection rate is
\begin{equation}
\dot{I}^{(q)} \approx \frac{\delta_c}{f_D}\left({\cal{R}}_0-1\right)^{1/k}.
\end{equation}
These early onset peak rates should arise not because
of herd immunity but because of changes in behavior. 

We evaluate this hypothesis in
Figure~\ref{fig.ID_day} for $k=1$, $k=2$, and $k=4$
given disease dynamics with $\beta=0.5$ /day, $\mu=1/2$ /day, $\gamma=1/6$
/day,
$f_D=0.01$, $N=10^7$, and $N\delta_c=50$ /day.  
As is evident, the rise and decline from peaks are not symmetric. Instead,
increasing nonlinearity of awareness
$a$ leads to shoulders where incidence decreases very slowly after a peak.
We interpret this finding to mean that as the awareness exponent $k$ increases,
individuals become less sensitive to fatality rates
where $\delta < \delta_c$ and more sensitive to fatality rates where $\delta > \delta_c$.  
The shoulders and plateaus emerge because of the balance
between relaxation of awareness-based
distancing (which leads to increases in cases and deaths) and an 
increase in awareness in response to increases in cases and deaths.  

\subsection{Short-term awareness and long-term plateaus}
Initial analysis of an SEIR model with short-term 
awareness of population-level severity suggests a generic outcome: 
fatalities will increases
exponentially before plateauing near to a level $\delta_c$.
In the event that $\delta_c/(\gamma f_D)$ is sufficiently high then susceptible
depletion will lead to the decline of cases and fatalities.
Figure~\ref{fig.generic} shows
the results of dynamics given $\delta_c$ values over a range 
equivalent to 5 to 500 deaths/day given a population of $10^7$
for $k=2$ (we note that results for $k=1$ and $k=4$ lead to similar
findings, see Figure~\ref{fig.generic_k1-4}.
We find that fatalities can be sustained at near-constant levels
for low values of $\delta_c$ (top)
even as the population remains susceptible at levels far above herd immunity (bottom).
%We also observe that as $k$ increases, then fatalities may overshoot
%the plateau. Overshoots arise because individuals initiate protective measures
%closer to the critical fatality rate.
%These overshoots may lead to oscillatory dynamics
%when there are larger lags between new cases and fatalities.

\subsection{Emergent oscillations given lags between cases and fatalities}
To explore the impacts of lags on dynamics,
we incorporated an additional class $H$,
assuming that fatalities follow potentially prolonged
hospital stays.  We do not include explicit
detailed information on symptomatic transmission, asymptomatic
transmission, hospitalization outcome,
age structure, and age-dependent risk (as in~\citep{ferguson2020report}). 
Instead, consider the extended SEIR model:
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{S} &=& -\frac{\beta SI}{\left[1+\left(\delta/\delta_c\right)^{k}\right]}\\
\dot{E} &=& \frac{\beta SI}{\left[1+\left(\delta/\delta_c\right)^{k}\right]}-\mu E\\
\dot{I} &=& \mu E-\gamma I \\
\dot{R} &=& (1-f_D)\gamma I\\
\dot{H} &=& f_D\gamma I - \gamma_H H\\
\dot{D} &=& \gamma_H H
\end{eqnarray}
where $T_H=1/\gamma_H$ defines the average time in a hospital
stay before a fatality. The earlier analysis of
the quasi-stationary equilibrium in fatalities holds; hence
we anticipate that dynamics should converge to $\delta=\delta^{(q)}$
at early times. However, increased delays between cases and
fatalities could lead to oscillations in both.  Indeed, this
is what we find via examination of models in which
$T_H$ ranges from 7 to 35 days, with increasing magnitude of
oscillations as $T_H$ increases (see Figure~\ref{fig.oscillate} 
for $k=2$ with qualitatively similar results for $k=1$ and
$k=4$ shown in Figure~\ref{fig.oscillate_k1-4}).

\subsection{Dynamical consequences of short-term and long-erm awareness}
Awareness can vary in duration, e.g., awareness
of SARS-1 may prepare individuals to more
readily adopt and retain
social distancing measures~\citep{chen_2020social,leung_lancet2020}.  
In previous
work, long-term awareness of cumulative incidence
was shown to lead to substantial decreases
in final size of epidemics compared
to baseline expectations from inferred 
strength~\citep{eksin2019systematic}. Hence, 
here we consider an extension of the SEIR model
with lags between infection and fatalities that incorporates
both short-term and long-term awareness:
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{S} &=& -\frac{\beta SI}{\left[1+\left(\delta/\delta_c\right)^{k}+\left(D/D_c\right)^k\right]}\\
\dot{E} &=& \frac{\beta SI}{\left[1+\left(\delta/\delta_c\right)^{k}+\left(D/D_c\right)^k\right]}-\mu E\\
\dot{I} &=& \mu E-\gamma I \\
\dot{R} &=& (1-f_D)\gamma I\\
\dot{H} &=& f_D\gamma I - \gamma_H H\\
\dot{D} &=& \gamma_H H
\end{eqnarray}
where $D_c$ denotes a critical cumulative fatality level
(and formally a half-saturation constant for the impact
of long-term awareness on distancing).
Note that the relative importance of short- and long-term
awareness can be modulated by $\delta_c$ and $D_c$ respectively.
Figure~\ref{fig.longterm} shows 
daily fatalities (top)
and cumulative fatalities (bottom)
for an SEIR model with ${\cal{R}}_0=2.5$, $T_H=14$ days, and $N\delta_c=50$ 
fatalities per day and critical cumulative fatalities of
$ND_c=2,500$, 5,000, 10,000 as well as a comparison case with vanishing
long-term awareness. As is evident, 
long-term awareness drives dynamics towards rapid declines
after reaching a peak. This decline arises because
$D$ monotonically increases;
increasing fatalities beyond $D_c$ leads to rapid suppression
of transmission.  However, when $\delta_c$ rather than
$D_c$ drives dynamics, then shoulders and plateaus can re-emerge.
In reality, we expect that individual
behavior is shaped by short- and long-term awareness of risks, including
the potential for `decay' of long-term awareness~\citep{funk2009spread,funk2010modelling}.

\section{Conclusions}
In summary, we have developed and analyzed
a model that assumes awareness of disease-induced death can 
reduce transmission and shown that such awareness-driven feedback
can lead
to highly asymmetric epidemic curves.  Asymmetric
curves exhibit extended periods of near-constant
cases even as the majority of the population remains susceptible.
In these conditions, if individuals are unable
to sustain social
distancing policies, or begin to tolerate higher death rates, then cases 
could increase (similar results have also been proposed in a recent, independently derived feedback SIR model~\citep{franco2020feedback}). 
Hence: passing a `peak' need not imply
the rapid decline of risk.  These types of impacts of awareness-driven
endogenous changes in ${\cal{R}}_{\mathrm{eff}}$ are typically
absent in models that form the basis for public policy and strategic planning.
Moving forward, we hope that our findings
highlight the impacts of short-term and long-term awareness 
in efforts to shape information campaigns
to reduce transmission after early onset `peaks', particularly
when populations remain predominantly immunologically naive.

Although the models here are intentionally simple,
we contend that as cumulative data from COVID-19 outbreaks already
indicate, the asymmetric post-peak dynamics of COVID-19, including
slow declines and plateau-like behavior, may be an emergent
property of awareness-driven epidemiological dynamics.
We recognize that qualititatively similar effects could arise 
if responses are due to case reports or to illnesses
with a personal connection. In addition, ongoing ascertainment
biases may also influence the shape of reported rather
than actual case curves.  
Moving forward, it is essential to fill in significant
gaps in understanding how awareness of disease
risk and severity shape behavior~\citep{west_nat2020}. 
Mobility data is a proxy but
not equivalent to a direct indicator of transmission
risk. Nonetheless, measurements of community
mobility have been
used as a pre-indicator for epidemic outcomes.
Prior work has shown significant impacts of changes
in mobility and behavior on the COVID-19 outbreak~\citep{kraemer_2020sci}.
Here we have
shown the importance of looking at a complementary feedback
mechanism,
i.e., from outbreak to behavior.  
%This feedback is key given
%that many mobility studies suggested that individuals began
%social distancing before shelter-in-place policies were instituted.
Understanding the drivers behind emergent plateaus observed
at national and sub-national levels could help decision
makers structure intervention efforts appropriately to effectively 
communicate awareness campaigns that may aid in collective
efforts to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
