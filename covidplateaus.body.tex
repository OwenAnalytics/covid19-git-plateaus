\section{Introduction}
The spread of COVID-19 has elevated the importance of epidemiological
models as a means to forecast both near- and long-term spread. 
In the United States, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)
model has emerged as a key influencer of state- and national-level
policy \citep{covid2020forecasting}.  
The IHME model includes a detailed characterization
of the variation in
hospital bed capacity, ICU beds, and ventilators between and within
states. Predicting the projected strains on underlying
health resources is critical to supporting planning efforts.
% (and related
%efforts are ongoing at both national~\citep{meyers} and
%state levels~\citep{upenn}).  
However such projections require
an epidemic `forecast'.  The IHME's epidemic forecast
differs from conventional
epidemic models in a significant way -- IHME assumes
that the cumulative deaths in the COVID-19 epidemic
follow a symmetric, Gaussian-like trajectory. (JD: Predefined not clear, maybe wrong)
%Vsuch that deaths go up, reach a peak,
%and then go back down.  This trajectory is symmetric
%by construction, such that the time it takes to reach the peak 
%must equal the time it takes to go back to normal.  
For example, the 
IHME model predicts that if the peak is 2 weeks away then in 4 weeks
cases will return to the level of the present, and continue
to diminish rapidly.  But, it is not the case
that epidemics must have one symmetric peak -- 
the archaic Farr's Law of Epidemics notwithstanding
(see~\citep{bregman1990farr} for a cautionary tale of the 
misapplication of Farr's law to the HIV epidemic). 

(JD: I would love to have the chance to simplify discussion of R below)

Conventional epidemic
models represent populations in terms of their `status' vis
a vis the infectious agent, in this case 
SARS-CoV-2 (e.g.,~\citep{ferguson2020report,kucharski2020early,kissler_medrxiv2020,park_medrxiv2020,kraemer_2020sci,li_science2020,wu2020estimating}),
That is, individuals
in a population are represented in different compartments, e.g.,
susceptible, exposed, infectious,
hospitalized, and recovered.  In many cases, epidemic models
might further categorize individuals by age and disease status, or age, occupation,
and disease status, and so on.  As a result, increases in cases
are a result of transmission events between infectious
and susceptible individuals.  The compounding effects 
of new transmission can lead to an exponential increases in cases 
when the basic reproduction number ${\cal{R}}_0>1$ (the
basic reproduction number denotes the average number of new
infections caused by a single, typical individual in an otherwise
susceptible population \citep{anderson1991infectious}).  Subsequent
spread, if left unchecked, would yield a single peak -- in theory. That 
peak corresponds to when `herd immunity' is reached, such
that the effective reproduction number, ${\cal{R}}_{eff}=1$.
The effective reproduction number denotes the number of new
infectious cases caused by a single infectious individual
in a population with pre-existing circulation; this number varies with
time depending on population state, disease characteristics, and 
social behavior.
(JD: mentioning social behaviour here created a weird conflation for me. The point of this \P\ is that we are assuming susceptible depletion is the main thing going on.)

But, even when herd immunity is reached, there will still be new cases which then
diminish over time, until the epidemic concludes.  
A single peak paradigm is
only robust insofar as the disease has spread
sufficiently in a population to reach and exceed `herd immunity'.
%In this way, the IHME (and other parametric fitting models) assume
%that social distancing will be sustained such that
%second peaks or other long-term trajectories are outside the bounds
%of forecasting uncertainty.
The converse
is also true in the case of COVID-19 -- as long as 
a population remains predominantly immunologically
naive, then the risk of further infection has not passed. 

The Imperial College of London (ICL) model~\citep{ferguson2020report} is
one of the earliest and most influential epidemic models that has shaped public health responses to COVID-19. The ICL model is an
example of a `conventional' epidemic model
%of new therapeutics and preserving health care resources 
%suggest
that shows the benefits of  early intervention steps in reducing
transmission and preserving health system resources vs.~ 
a `herd immunity' strategy.  Unlike the IHME model,
the ICL model suggests that more than one peak is possible.
The ICL model assumes that
transmission is reduced because of externalities, like lockdowns,
school closings, and so on.  For a disease
that is already the documented cause of more than 50,000 deaths
in the United States, we posit that individuals, 
are likely to continue to modify
their behavior even after lockdowns are lifted.  
Hence, here, we use a simple model to
ask the question: what is the anticipated
shape of an epidemic if individuals modify their behavior in direct
response to the impact of a disease at the population level? In doing so,
we build upon earlier work on awareness based models (e.g.~\citep{funk2009spread,funk2010modelling,eksin2017disease, eksin2019systematic}) with a
simple, initial assumption: individuals reduce interactions when 
death rates are high and increase interactions when death rates are low.  

To begin, consider a SEIR like model
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{S} &=& -\frac{\beta SI}{\left[1+\left(\delta/\delta_c\right)^{k}\right]}\\
\dot{E} &=& \frac{\beta SI}{\left[1+\left(\delta/\delta_c\right)^{k}\right]}-\mu E\\
\dot{I} &=& \mu E-\gamma I \\
\dot{R} &=& (1-f_D)\gamma I\\
\dot{D} &=& f_D\gamma I
\end{eqnarray}
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\dot{S} &=& -\beta SI a(\vec{x}) \\
%\dot{E} &=& \beta SI} a(\vec{x})}-\mu E\\
%\dot{I} &=& \mu E-\gamma I \\
%\dot{R} &=& (1-f_D)\gamma I
%\dot{D} &=& f_D)\gamma I
%\end{eqnarray}
%where $a(\vec{x})$ denotes awareness-based distancing given the
%epidemiological phase space
where $S$, $E$, $I$, $R$, and $D$ denote the proportions of
susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered, and deaths, respectively.
The awareness-based distancing is controlled by 
the death rate $\delta\equiv \dot{D}$,
the half-saturation constant ($\delta_c>0$), and
the sharpness of change in the force of infection ($k\geq 1$).
Since $\delta$ is proportional to $I$, this model is closely related to a recently proposed awareness-based distancing model~\citep{eksin2019systematic}.
Note that the present
model converges to the conventional SEIR model as $\delta_c\rightarrow \infty$.

Typically, epidemics arising in SEIR models have a single case peak, corresponding 
to the point where $\gamma I = \beta S I $ such that 
$S=1/{\cal{R}}_0$, equivalent to when the herd
immunity level proportion of individuals
$1-1/{\cal{R}}_0$ have been infected.
However, when individuals decrease transmission in relationship
to awareness of the current severity of the disease, $\delta(t)$,
then the system can `peak' when levels of infected cases are
far from herd immunity, specifically when
\begin{equation}
\gamma I = \frac{\beta SI}{\left[1+\left(\delta/\delta_c\right)^{k}\right]}.
\end{equation}
When $\delta_c$ is small compared to the death rate of infectious individuals $(\gamma f_D)$ we anticipate that individual behavior will respond quickly to the disease outbreak.
Hence, we hypothesize that the
emergence of an
awareness-based peak can occur early, i.e., $S(t)\approx 1$, consistent
with a quasi-stationary equilibrium when the death rate is
\begin{equation}
\delta^{(q)} \approx \delta_c\left({\cal{R}}_0-1\right)^{1/k}
\end{equation}
and the infection rate is
\begin{equation}
\dot{I}^{(q)} \approx \frac{\delta_c}{f_D}\left({\cal{R}}_0-1\right)^{1/k}.
\end{equation}
These early onset peak rates should arise not because
of herd immunity but because of changes in behavior. 

We evaluate this hypothesis in
Figure~\ref{fig.ID_day} for $k=1$, $k=2$, and $k=4$
given disease dynamics with $\beta=0.5$ /day, $\mu=1/2$ /day, $\gamma=1/6$
/day,
$f_D=0.01$, $N=10^7$, and $N\delta_c=50$ /day.  
%In a population of $N=10^7$, the
%critical fatality awareness level is equivalent to a rate 100 fatalities
%per day, but given the duration of illness, with mean generation
%interval of 8 days, then one can consider this critical awareness
%level as an approximation of daily fatality rates over week-long periods.
As is evident, the rise and decline from peaks are not symmetric. Instead,
increasing nonlinearity of awareness
$a$ leads to shoulders where incidence decreases very slowly after a peak.
(JD: maybe we should make shoulders instead of plateaus our brand; this text seems a digression.)
and, in the limit of $k\gg 1$, plateaus, such that
deaths and cases appear nearly constant and close to the quasi-stationary
equilibrium, declining slowly because of the
depletion of susceptibles.  
We interpret this finding to mean that as the awareness exponent $k$ increases,
individuals become less sensitive to fatality rates
where $\delta < \delta_c$ and more sensitive to fatality rates where $\delta > \delta_c$.  
The shoulders and plateaus emerge because of the balance
between relaxation of awareness-based
distancing (which leads to increases in cases and deaths) and an 
increase in awareness in response to increases in cases and deaths.  

These results suggest a generic outcome: first fatalities will grow
exponential before plateauing near to the fatality awareness level $\delta_c$.
In the event that $\delta_c/(\gamma f_D)$ is sufficiently high then susceptible
depletion will lead to the decline of cases and fatalities.
Figure~\ref{fig.generic} shows
the results of dynamics given $\delta_c$ values over a range 
equivalent to 5 to 500 deaths/day given a population of $10^7$
for $k=2$ (we note that results for $k=1$ and $k=4$ lead to similar
findings, and are included in the \verb|github| repository).
We find that fatalities are sustained at near-constant levels (left)
even as the population remains susceptible at levels far above herd immunity (right).
We observed that as $k$ increases, then fatalities may overshoot
the plateau. This arises because individuals wait to initiate distancing
closer to when a critical fatality rate has been reached.
These overshoots may lead to oscillatory dynamics
when there are larger lags between new cases and fatalities
(whether due to reporting or due to delays arising because of disease
etiology and treatment).

To explore the impacts of oscillations
we incorporated an additional class $H$,
assuming that fatalities follow potentially prolonged
hospital stays.  We do not include explicit
detailed information on symptomatic transmission, asymptomatic
transmission, hospitalization outcome,
age structure, and age-dependent risk. Instead, 
consider the extended SEIR model:
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{S} &=& -\frac{\beta SI}{\left[1+\left(\delta/\delta_c\right)^{k}\right]}\\
\dot{E} &=& \frac{\beta SI}{\left[1+\left(\delta/\delta_c\right)^{k}\right]}-\mu E\\
\dot{I} &=& \mu E-\gamma I \\
\dot{R} &=& (1-f_D)\gamma I\\
\dot{H} &=& f_D\gamma a I - \gamma_H H\\
\dot{D} &=& \gamma_H H
\end{eqnarray}
where $T_H=1/\gamma_H$ defines the average time in a hospital
stay before a fatality. The earlier analysis of
the quasi-stationary equilibrium in fatalities holds; hence
we anticipate that dynamics should converge to $\delta=\delta^{(q)}$
at early times. However, increased delays between cases and
fatalities could lead to oscillations in both.  Indeed, this
is what we find via examination of models in which
$T_H$ ranges from 7 to 35 days, with increasing magnitude of
oscillations as $T_H$ increases (see Figure~\ref{fig.oscillate} 
for $k=2$ with qualitatively similar results for $k=1$ and
$k=4$ on the \verb|github|).
In essence, delays between infection and fatalities can lead to larger oscillations,
as individual behavior changes due to local awareness of deaths.  Reduction in 
contacts when fatality rates exceed the critical awareness level do not translate
into reductions for a period similar to that of $T_H$ , such that deaths can then be driven
below this critical value, then contacts increase, and deaths increase (again with
a lag), and so on.  
We note that these oscillations could be amplified 
in stochastic models.

%fatality-based awareness
%to the case of COVID-19, including 
%detailed information on symptomatic, asymptomatic, hospitalization,
%cases, age structure, and age-dependent risk.  In doing so we
%consider a model of COVID-19 with a ${\cal{R}}_0=2.32$ and an
%incidence fatality rate of 0.82\%. Figure~\ref{fig.covid-plat}}
%shows that the insights from the SEIR model generalize to
%the case of COVID-19 dynamics, albeit with some differences.  In particular, we
%find that deaths exceed $D_c$ because of the lag between 
%new infection and fatalities (with a mean of 20 days in the current model).  Further
%delays between infection and fatalities can lead to larger oscillations,
%as individual behavior changes due to local awareness of deaths.  Reduction in 
%contacts when fatality rates exceed the critical awareness level do not translate
%into reductions for a period of 20 days, such that deaths can then be driven
%below this critical value, then contacts increase, and deaths increase (again with

%\end{figure}

Finally, we recognize that awareness can vary in duration.  In previous
work, long-term awareness of cumulative incidence
was shown to lead to substantial decreases
in final size of epidemics compared
to baseline expectations from inferred 
strength~\citep{eksin2019systematic}. Hence, 
here we consider an extension of the SEIR model
with lags between infection and fatalities that also incorporates
both short-term and long-term awareness:
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{S} &=& -\frac{\beta SI}{\left[1+\left(\delta/\delta_c\right)^{k}+\left(D/D_c\right)^k\right]}\\
\dot{E} &=& \frac{\beta SI}{\left[1+\left(\delta/\delta_c\right)^{k}+\left(D/D_c\right)^k\right]}-\mu E\\
\dot{I} &=& \mu E-\gamma I \\
\dot{R} &=& (1-f_D)\gamma I\\
\dot{H} &=& f_D\gamma a I - \gamma_H H\\
\dot{D} &=& \gamma_H H
\end{eqnarray}
where $D_c$ denotes a critical cumulative fatality level. 
Note that the relative importance of short- and long-term
awareness can be modulated by $\delta_c$ and $D_c$ respectively.
Figure~\ref{fig.longterm} shows cumulative fatalities (left)
and daily fatalities (right)
for a SEIR model with ${\cal{R}}_0=2.5$, $T_H=14$ days, and $N\delta_c=50$ 
fatalities per day and critical cumulative fatalities of
$ND_c=2,500$, 5,000, 10,000 as well as a comparison case with vanishing
long-term awareness. As is evident, 
long-term awareness drives dynamics towards rapid declines
after reaching a peak. This decline arises because
$D$ monotonically increases;
increasing fatalities beyond $D_c$ leads to rapid suppression
of transmission.  However, when $\delta_c$ rather than
$D_c$ drives dynamics, then shoulders and plateaus can re-emerge.
In reality, we expect that individual
behavior is shaped by short- and long-term awareness of risks, including
the potential for `decay' of long-term awareness~\citep{funk2009spread,funk2010modelling}.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

In summary, we have shown how awareness-driven avoidance of transmission
when fatality rates exceed critical levels can lead
to sustained plateaus, shoulders, and lag-driven oscillatory dynamics
in epidemiological dynamics.
Sustained levels of fatalities occur even as the majority
of the population remains
susceptible. Hence, if individuals tire of or are unable
to sustain social
distancing policies, or begin to tolerate higher death rates, then cases 
could increase. 
%In contrast, we also showed that long-term awareness would lead to a faster
%peak decline (see \cite{eksin2019systematic}). 
%As detailed here,
%if short-term awareness predominates, then COVID-19 dynamics may result
%in plateau- and shoulder-like behavior, including the possiblity of 
%lag-driven oscillations.  
As a result, passing a `peak' need not imply
the rapid decline of risk. The impacts of awareness-driven
endogenous changes in ${\cal{R}}_{eff}$ is often
absent in models that form the basis for public policy and strategic planning.
More optimistically, we hope that our findings
highlight the value of long-term awareness 
in efforts to shape information campaigns
to reduce transmission after early onset `peaks', particularly
when populations remain predominantly immunologically naive.
%model. The IHME model predicts peaks and rapid declines, building upon 
%the curve-fitting approach of Farr's law posited in 1840 before the
%germ theory of disease.  Thirty years ago reserachers revived Farr's Law, in part, 
%to predict the scope of the HIV epidemic, e.g., in 1990
%the law was used to extrapolate to a peak HIV epidemic size of 200,000 cases by the 
%mid-1990s\citep{bregman1990farr};
%in contrast
%there were nearly 2 million new AIDS cases reported last year alone. Relying
%on curve fits to early cases to forecast
%early declines in the absence of population-wide immunity can be exponentially wrong.
Although the models here are intentionally simple,
we contend that as cumulative data from COVID19 outbreaks already
indicate, the asymmetric post-peak dynamics of COVID-19, including
slow declines and plateau-like behavior, may be an emergent
property of awareness-driven epidemiological dynamics.
